      <p>means what exactly? The scope of the show, budget of the producer, and contents of the script vary greatly week to week. But the one thing that never changes is the hard work, deadlines, and the collaborative experience. My experience as a freelance theater designer in Philadelphia means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>terabytes of content that didn't make the cut</li>
        <li>weeks of 12+ hours in tech</li>
        <li>hundreds of shows, events and venues</li>
        <li>thousands of different team-mates</li>
        <li>countless stories told</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Well, can do use third party APIs?</h3>

      <p>Yes! But don't take my word for it, just ask for references.</p>
      <h3>Do you know how to git?</h3>
      <p>yeah, I can git</p>
